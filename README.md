# Ecommerce Online Store Project

This project was made using technologies such as __React__, __Javascript__, __Redux Toolkit__, __CSS Modules__. 
To create this project i used REST API - [Fake Sore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). For tracking the state of the application i used Redux Toolkit.

The following pages are implemented in the application: Home, Products, Page of Single Product, Page of specific category of products, Cart.

I also developed functionality to add products to cart, increase/decrease the number of products in the cart, as well as delete from the cart. 

Moreover, i have included the possibility of login. Unfortunately, Fake Store Api gives the opportunity to login only to users who are included in the database.
